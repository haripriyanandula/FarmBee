                  <p>Regions – Alluvial soils can be found mainly in the northern Indian delta areas. Such soils cover over 35
                    percent of India’s total land.<br><br>Characteristics – Such soils are rich nutrients, such as phosphoric
                    acid and organic (humus) matter. We are low in both nitrogen and potash, however. Alluvial soils are a
                    blend
                    of clay and (loam) sand. Such soils appear to be more sandy and can drain property faster than many other
                    soils.<br><br>Suitable Crops of Alluvial Soils – In these soils under ideal irrigation, tobacco, cotton,
                    rice, wheat, bajra, sorghum (jowar), pea, pigeon pea, chickpea, black gram, green gram, soya, groundnut,

                    width="35%" height="50%">
                  <p>Regions – Black soils are also known as Cotton or Regur Soil. Such soils are found primarily in the
                    Deccan
                    lava tract that includes the Telangana, Andhra Pradesh, Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu, Madhya Pradesh, and
                    Gujarat
                    states. Mostly, this type of soils can be found in the Godavari, Krishna, Narmada, and Tapi river valleys.
                    Because of weathering of the lava rocks, black soils form.<br><br>Characteristics – Black soils are rich
                    in
                    aluminum, iron, lime, magnesium and. Their phosphorus, nitrogen, and humus (organic matter) are weak
                    though.
                    Typically during soil formation, this soil gets its black color from various salts or from humus. Black
                    soils contain a significant quantity of clay but are often sandy in the country’s hills. When wet, the
                    black
                    soils become sticky and develop large cracks during the dry season.<br><br>Suitable Crops of Black Soils –
                    The moisture of the black soil is very strong hence it is excellent for cotton growing. This is also known
                    popularly as black cotton soil. In these soils, however, there are many other crops that can be grown;
                    rice
                    and sugar cane, wheat, jowar, linseed, sunflower, cereal crops, citrus fruits, tomatoes, tobacco,

                    Ghats.<br><br>Characteristics – Owing to the presence of iron oxide these soils are red in color. These
                    are
                    formed due to metamorphic rocks being weathered. These soils are sandy and mildly acidic, and potash-rich.
                    They are however very low in lime, phosphorus, phosphorous, magnesium, organic (humus)

                    that
                    are important for plant growth and improved yield. Within the specific range, water level PH will be
                    maintained resulting in better growth and production. Plants take the nutrients from the water in this
                    farming and use sunlight to produce the production. As we said it is soilless farming, in the absence of
                    soil, one should make sure to replace the essential soil functions that must be given in water in water

                  <h2>What is Agriculture Machinery?</h2>
                  <p>Agricultural machinery is machinery used in farming for agriculture. There are many types of equipment
                    used
                    by farmers they are hand tools, power tools like tractors. These equipment are used in both organic and
                    nonorganic farming. </p>
                  <p>Tractors:<br><br>
                    The tractor is a farm vehicle. Agriculture implements to be mounted on the tractor and it may also provide
                    a
                    source of power if the implement is mechanized. Farm tractor is used for pulling and pushing agriculture
                    machinery. It is used for plowing, tilling, disking, harrowing, and planting.
                    There are two types;<br>
                    • Two-wheel tractor<br>
                    • Tracked tractor or Caterpillar tractor<br><br>
                    Soil cultivation:<br><br>
                    A cultivator is a farm implement for stirring and pulverizing the soil before planting. It also removes
                    weeds and to aerate and loosen the soil after the crop has begun to grow.<br><br>

                    Plough:<br>
                    A Plough is used for initial cultivation of soil in preparation for sowing seed and planting. The purpose
                    of
                    Ploughing is to turn over the upper layer of the soil. It bringing fresh nutrients to the surface and
                    remains of previous crops, allowing them to break down. In modern use, a Ploughing field is typically left
                    to dry out and then harrowed before planting.<br><br>
                    Harrows<br>
                    A Harrows is an implement for cultivating the surface of the soil. It is different in its effect on Plough
                    and used for deeper cultivation. It is often used to carry out on fields for Ploughing operations. It
                    provides a finer finish, for a good soil structure that is suitable for seeding and planting
                    operations.<br><br>

                    Cultivator: Cultivator equipment is a farm device for stirring and pulverizing the soil before planting or
                    removing weeds and aerating and loosening the soil after growing. It is operated by a tractor and stirs
                    the
                    soil to a higher depth than the harrow (which is not normally powered). Many are fitted with hydraulic
                    wings
                    that fold to make it easier and safer to ride on the road. Different devices are used for gardening, but
                    very small.<br>
                    Cultipacker: A Cultipacker is a piece of farming equipment that crushes dirt clods, eliminates air
                    pockets,
                    and presses down small stones to create a smooth, firm seedbed. The term Cultipacker applies exclusively
                    to
                    ridged rollers, whereas either a smooth or a ridged roller can be referred to in the terms field roller or
                    land roller. Many farmers find the terms to be mutually exclusive, but others regard the ridged as a field
                    roller category.<br>
                    Plough: In preparation for sowing seed, a plow or plow is used for initial soil cultivation. The key
                    plowing
                    role is to turn over the upper layer of the soil, bringing to the surface fresh nutrients. This aerates
                    the
                    soil and increases the retention of moisture. Usually left to dry out a plowed field in modern use and
                    then
                    harrowed before planting.<br>
                    Rotary tiller: It is also referred to as a rotavator, revolving hoe, power tiller, or rotary plow. It is a
                    motorized grower that uses spinning blades to work the soil. Rotary tillers are either driven by
                    themselves
                    or pulled behind a tractor as an extension.<br>
                    Strip-till: Strip-till is a minimal tillage management method. This combines the soil drying and heating
                    advantages of traditional tillage with the no-till soil-protecting advantages by disrupting only the
                    portion
                    of the soil comprising the seed line. This tillage is done with special tools and produces multiple trips,
                    depending on the tillage tool used and the conditions of the field. Each strip-tilled row is typically
                    around 8-10 inches wide.<br>
                    Harrows: Harrows machinery is used for ground surface cultivation. It is different from the plow that is
                    used for deeper cultivation in its effect. Harrowing is often achieved by plowing operations on fields to
                    meet the rough end. This harrowing’s main purpose is to break up lumps of soil and provide a finer finish,
                    a
                    good soil structure ideal for seeding and planting. Harrowing can be used after sowing to kill weeds and
                    cover crops. There are three main types of harrows: spike harrows, drag harrows, and disc harrows.<br><br>
                    Farm machinery used for planting:<br>
                    Seed drill: This is a device for placing the seeds at a uniform rate and at a controlled depth with or
                    without the arrangement to cover them with soil in a continuous flow in furrows.<br>
                    This ensures even distribution of seeds. At the exact seeding rate and depth, the seed drill sows the
                    seeds,
                    ensuring that the seeds are covered by soil. This saves them from being eaten or dried up by animals as a
                    result of sun exposure.<br>
                    Broadcast seeder: A broadcast seeder or spreader or fertilizer spreader is a commonly used crop, lime or
                    fertilizer spreading tractor tool.<br>
                    Seed cum fertilizer drill: Seed drills are equipped with an attachment to drop fertilizer; spread the
                    fertilizer on the field evenly. It’s called a fertilizer drill seed material. Such a drill has a wide seed
                    box that is lengthwise divided into two compartments, one for seed and one for fertilizers. Seed drill may
                    be graded as (i) Drawn Bullock (ii) Drawn Tractor.<br><br>
                    Farm Machinery used for fertilizing and pest control:<br>
                    Manure spreader: Manure spreader is also known as a muck spreader or a honey wagon is an agricultural tool
                    used as a fertilizer for the spreading of manure over a field. Manure spreaders began as ground-driven
                    devices that a horse or group of horses would pull out.<br>
                    Slurry tank: A slurry tank is a vehicle with a tank and pump that can be used to fertilize the fields with
                    slurry (a combination of manure and water). If we fertilize fields, at the end of the season we get more
                    plants.<br>
                    Sprayer: A sprayer is a device used to apply herbicides, pesticides, and fertilizers to farm crops.
                    Sprayers
                    range in size from man-portable units (typical spray-powered backpacks) to tractor-related self-propelled
                    units.<br><br>
                    Farm Machinery types used for irrigation:<br>
                    Irrigation equipment: Varieties of irrigation equipment are used for irrigation, depending on the farm
                    operator’s financing ability and the appropriateness of the method according to water sources.<br>
                    Fire sprinkler system: A fire sprinkler system is an effective form of fire protection, consisting of
                    water
                    supplying a network, providing adequate pressure and flow rate to a water delivery piping structure
                    connected to by fire sprinklers.<br>
                    Centre Irrigation: Irrigation is usually the artificial transfer of water to the soil to help grow crops.
                    It
                    is mostly used for crop production in dry areas and in rainfall shortages, but to protect crops from
                    frost.
                    Irrigation is the opposite drainage procedure, which is the natural or artificial removal from a given
                    area
                    of the surface and sub-surface water.<br><br>
                    Farm Machinery for Harvesting and threshing equipment:<br>
                    Equipment for harvesting is a mechanical device used to harvest. There are several harvesting machine
                    types
                    that are typically categorized by the plant. Below are some of the harvesting equipment used;<br>
                    Combine harvester: A combine harvester is a tool that combines planting, threshing, and cleaning of grain
                    crops. The main goal is plant planting, corn, soybeans, flax (linseed), oats.<br>
                    Sickle: A sickle tool is a curved shaped, hand-held farming device that is usually used to harvest grain
                    crops or cut grass for hay.<br>
                    Mower: Mower is a plant or grass cutting tool. The mower can be powered by steam, operated by hand or
                    drawn
                    by animals.<br>
                    Reaper: Reaper is a tool used for ground-level cereal harvesting. Such reapers are powered either by the
                    power tiller or by the tractor. The reaper worked on the tractor’s field strength varies from 0.2 to 0.4
                    ha
                    per hour.<br>
                    Conveyor belt: A conveyor belt is the carrying medium (often shortened to belt conveyor) of a conveyor
                    belt
                    structure. One of the major types of conveyor systems is a belt conveyor system. This system consists of
                    two
                    or more pulleys (sometimes called drums) with an endless loop of moving media and the conveyor belt
                    revolving around them. One or both of the pulleys are powered, moving forward the belt and the material on
                    the belt. The driven pulley is called the drive pulley, and the weak pulley is called the idler
                    pulley.<br>
                    Crop harvesting machine: The mechanical tool that is concurrently built to harvest forage crops grown in
                    the
                    upland or field and forms roll bale is called plant harvesting machinery. The system consists of moving,
                    harvesting and a part of the baler.<br>
                    Vegetable harvesting machine: Most computers are now available for vegetable harvesting. But, among global
                    vegetable farmers, these are quite popular.<br>
                    That’s all about the styles of farm machinery, farm tools, farm equipment, and their uses.

                  <p>Organic farming, a farming system using ecologically oriented pest controls and biological fertilizers
                    mainly obtained from animal and plant waste and nitrogen-fixing plants. Modern organic farming has been
                    created as a reaction to the environmental damage caused by the use of chemical pesticides and synthetic
                    fertilizers in conventional farming and has many ecological advantages.<br>
                    Organic farming utilizes fewer pesticides compared to conventional farming, reduces soil erosion, reduces
                    nitrate leaching into groundwater and surface water, and recycles animal waste back into the farm. Higher
                    food expenses for customers and usually reduced returns counterbalance these advantages. In fact, organic
                    crop yields have been discovered to be approximately 25 percent lower overall than conventionally grown
                    plants, although this may differ significantly based on the crop type.

                  <h2>Organic Farming Methods</h2>
                  <p>Fertilizers:<br>
                    Since synthetic fertilizers are not used, it is a concern for organic farmers to build and maintain a
                    wealthy, living soil by adding organic matter. By applying manure, compost, and animal by-products such as
                    feather meal or blood meal, organic matter can be utilized. The USDA National Organic Standards require
                    that
                    raw manure be applied no later than 90 or 120 days before harvest, depending on whether the harvested
                    portion of the plant is in touch with the floor, due to the potential for harboring human pathogens.
                    Composted manure that has been turned 5 times in 15 days and reached temperatures between 55-77.2 ° C
                    (131-171 ° F) has no implementation time constraints. Compost contributes to organic matter, supplying
                    crops
                    with a broad variety of nutrients, adding beneficial microbes to the soil. Because these nutrients are
                    mostly unmineralized and can not be taken up by crops, soil microbes are required to break down organic
                    matter and convert nutrients into a “mineralized” bioavailable state. Synthetic fertilizers, by contrast,
                    are already in mineralized form and can be taken straight by crops.<br><br>
                    Soil:<br>
                    Soil is maintained through planting and then tilling in cover crops that help protect the soil from
                    off-season erosion and provide additional organic matter. Also adding nitrogen to the soil is tilling in
                    nitrogen-fixing cover crops such as clover or alfalfa. Cover crops are usually planted before or after the
                    cash crop season or in combination with crop rotation and may also be planted between some crop rows, such
                    as tree fruits. Researchers and farmers are working to develop “no lamination” and reduced lamination
                    practices for organic farming to further reduce erosion.<br><br>
                    Pest control:<br>
                    Organic pesticides are obtained from sources that occur naturally. These include living organisms such as
                    the Bacillus thuringiensis bacteria used to manage caterpillar pests, or plant derivatives such as
                    pyrethrins (from Chrysanthemum cinerariifolium’s dried flower heads) or neem oil (from Azadirachta
                    indica’s
                    seeds). Inorganic pesticides based on minerals such as sulfur and copper are also permitted.<br><br>
                    Organic pest control integrates biological, cultural and genetic controls in addition to pesticides to
                    minimize pest damage. Biological control is used to attack insect pests by natural enemies such as
                    predatory
                    insects (e.g., ladybugs) or parasitoids (e.g., certain wasps). Cultural controls can disrupt the cycles of
                    plague, the most commonly used of which is crop rotation. Finally, traditional plant breeding has
                    generated
                    countless pest-resistant crop varieties. The use of such varieties and planting genetically diverse crops
                    provide genetic control of pests and many diseases of plants.<br><br>
                    The need for organic farming:<br>
                    With population growth, our obligation would be not only to stabilize agricultural output but to further
                    boost it in a sustainable way. Scientists have noticed that the high-input’ Green Revolution’ has reached
                    a
                    plateau and is now maintained by dropping dividend returns. Thus, for the existence of life and assets, a
                    natural balance must be preserved at all costs. In the present era, when these agrochemicals that are
                    manufactured from fossil fuel and are not renewable and decrease in supply, the apparent option for that
                    would be more important. In the future, it may also cost our foreign exchange strongly.<br><br>
                    The key characteristics of organic farming<br>
                    • Protecting long-term soil fertility by keeping concentrations of organic matter, promoting soil
                    biological
                    activity and mechanical care<br>
                    • Providing indirect crop nutrients with comparatively insoluble nutrient sources made accessible to the
                    plant through the action of soil microorganisms<br>
                    • Self-sufficiency of nitrogen through the use of legumes and biological fixation of nitrogen, as well as
                    efficient recycling of organic products including crop residues and animal manures<br>
                    • Weed, disease and pest control are primarily based on crop rotations, natural predators, diversity,
                    organic manure, resistant varieties and limited thermal, biological and chemical intervention (preferably
                    minimal).<br>
                    • Extensive livestock management, paying full attention to their evolutionary adaptations, behavioral
                    needs
                    and issues of animal welfare in nutrition, housing, health, breeding, and rearing<br>
                    • Careful attention to the effect of the farming scheme on the wider setting and wildlife and habitat

                  <h2>What is Verticle farming?</h2>
                  <p>Vertical farming is the way to produce food and medication in vertically piled layers, vertically
                    inclined
                    surfaces and/or incorporated into other structures such as a skyscraper, used warehouse or shipping
                    container. The Modern concepts of vertical farming use techniques of indoor farming and technology of
                    controlled-environment-farming (CEA), where many environmental factors can be regulated.<br>
                    These facilities use artificial light power, climate regulates (humidity, temperature, gases) and
                    fertilization. Vertical farming is related in many ways to greenhouses where natural sunlight is boosted
                    by
                    metal reflectors and artificial lighting. Vertical farming’s main objective is to maximize crop production
                    in a limited space.<br><br>
                    How Vertical Farming Works?<br><br>
                    There are four critical areas in understanding how vertical farming works:<br>
                    • Physical layout.<br>
                    • Lighting.<br>
                    • Growing medium.<br>
                    • Sustainability features.<br>
                    First, vertical farming’s primary objective is to produce more food per square meter. To achieve this
                    goal,
                    crops are grown in a tower life structure in stacked layers. Second, to maintain the perfect light level
                    in
                    the room, a perfect combination of natural and artificial lights is used. To enhance lighting efficiency,
                    technologies such as revolving chairs are used.<br>
                    Third, aeroponic, aquaponic or hydroponic growing materials are used instead of soil. In vertical farming,
                    peat moss or coconut husks and similar non-soil mediums are very common. Finally, the vertical method of
                    farming uses different sustainability features to offset farming’s energy cost. Vertical farming actually
                    utilizes 95% less water.<br>
                  </p>

                  <h2>What can you grow in your vertical farm?</h2>
                  <p>You can develop practically anything with the correct hydroponic, aeroponic, or aquaponic farm set-up.
                    However, just because you can do this doesn’t mean you should. When selecting the best crops for your
                    vertical farm, consider the original aspects.<br><br>
                    1. Economic viability:<br>
                    Especially if you’re growing for profit, research the economy of the species that you have selected for
                    your
                    indoor farm.<br><br>
                    A. Demand:<br>
                    What is the demand in your area or the market you choose to serve for this crop? You may decide that both
                    your families and your local society will benefit from your project.<br><br>
                    B. Growing technique:<br>
                    Although vertical farming techniques mean lowered overheads on average, your manufacturing expenses are
                    determined by the quantity and specific system you use. These numbers will be kept as minimal as
                    possible.<br><br>
                    C. Climate:<br>
                    Different machines have climatic requirements (heating, cooling, and lighting), which may require a
                    separate
                    space. Consider if you have the proposal for your chosen hardware design for space and activities.<br><br>
                    2. Timing and liability:<br>
                    It takes time for all good things — patience is a necessary element of indoor farming. This truth is
                    embodied in what is referred to as a’ turn’ in farming. A turn is the total amount of time it takes to
                    introduce a seed or seedling into the farm system, grow it, and harvest it as a mature plant for market
                    sale
                    or serving on your plate.<br><br>
                    You can choose to grow two types of crops: fast turning crops and slow turning crops. You can choose
                    either
                    one or both for your vertical farm, depending on your increasing cause, wants, and demands.<br><br>
                    Fast-turn crops include lettuce, chard, collard greens, mustard greens, parsley, cilantro, mint, chives,
                    basil, and a variety of microgreens. They’re usually producing for up to six weeks.<br><br>
                    Typically, slow turning crops are harder to grow but have a higher income margin compared to leafy greens.
                    This includes’ woody’ herbs such as oregano and rosemary and crops such as strawberries and tomatoes. For
                    a
                    beginner grower, a good guide is to plant 80% greens and 20% Herbs.

                            Greenhouse Farming is the process of cultivating crops and vegetable in a greenhouse ecosystems
                            environment. Cultivation in greenhouses is a practice that has allowed farmers to increase their
                            performance, while improving the quality of products, isolating them in micro-ecosystems that have the
                            ideal
                            conditions for plants to grow healthy, strong and beautiful.

                             height="50%">
                        <p>
                            Classification of greenhouse based on suitability and cost:<br><br>
                            a) Low cost or low tech greenhouse<br>
                            Low cost greenhouse is a simple structure constructed with locally available materials such as bamboo,
                            timber etc. The ultra violet (UV) film is used as cladding materials. Unlike conventional or hi-tech
                            greenhouses, no specific control device for regulating environmental parameters inside the greenhouse are
                            provided. Simple techniques are, however, adopted for increasing or decreasing the temperature and
                            humidity.
                            Even light intensity can be reduced by incorporating shading materials like nets. The temperature can be
                            reduced during summer by opening the side walls. Such structure is used as rain shelter for crop
                            cultivation. Otherwise, inside temperature is increased when all sidewalls are covered with plastic film.
                            This type of greenhouse is mainly suitable for cold climatic zone.<br><br>

                            b) Medium-tech greenhouse<br>
                            Greenhouse users prefers to have manually or semiautomatic control arrangement owing to minimum
                            investment.
                            This type of greenhouse is constructed using galvanized iron (G.I) pipes. The canopy cover is attached
                            with
                            structure with the help of screws. Whole structure is firmly fixed with the ground to withstand the
                            disturbance against wind. Exhaust fans with thermostat are provided to control the temperature.
                            Evaporative
                            cooling pads and misting arrangements are also made to maintain a favourable humidity inside the
                            greenhouse.
                            As these system are semi-automatic, hence, require a lot of attention and care, and it is very difficult
                            and
                            cumbersome to maintain uniform environment throughout the cropping period. These greenhouses are suitable
                            for dry and composite climatic zones.<br><br>
                            c) Hi-tech greenhouse<br>
                            To overcome some of the difficulties in medium-tech greenhouse, a hi-tech greenhouse where the entire
                            device, controlling the environment parameters, are supported to function automatically.<br><br>
                            Cost involved:<br>
                            1. Less expensive greenhouse without fan and pad Rs.300 to 500/m2<br>
                            2. Medium cost greenhouse with pad and fan system without automation Rs.800 to Rs.1100/m2<br>

                            3. Expensive greenhouses with fully automatic control system Rs.2000 to Rs.3500/m2

                  <p>There are the two kinds of crop damage that may be caused by insect pests:<br>
                    • Direct injury to the crop caused by insect feeding<br>
                    • Indirect damage in which insects transmit diseases<br><br>
                    The most common way of damaging the crops is through direct injury, caused by feeding on above-ground and
                    below-ground plant parts. This type of direct crop injury is related to the insect's mouthparts. For
                    example, insects with chewing mouthparts, such as beetles, damage the crop by chewing the leaves or some
                    other plant parts. Moreover, some of them cause damage by boring into the plant tissue, such as stem
                    boring
                    insects or leaf miners.

                    height="50%">
                  <p>Outside of damaging the crop by directly feeding on a plant tissue, insects can cause serious crop losses
                    by transmitting the diseases as well. Insect pests that transmit plant diseases are called vectors. They
                    usually transmit viral, bacterial or fungal diseases.<br><br>
                    <b>There are the three ways insects transmit disease:</b><br>
                    1. Accidental or incidental transmission; the disease occurs through feeding or oviposition injury caused
                    by
                    the insect; for example, the Beet Curly Top Virus is caused by Beet Leafhopper feeding<br>
                    2. Passive transmission; the insect transmits the disease from one plant to another; for example: bees can
                    transmit bacterium Erwinia amylovora that causes Apple Fire Blight Disease<br>
                    3. Active transmission; the disease occurs when the insect that carries the pathogen feeds on a plant, and
                    then moves on to a healthy plant and transmits the pathogen.<br><br>
                    Generally, it’s estimated that various pests (insects, weeds, nematodes, animals, diseases) each year
                    cause
                    crop yield losses of 20-40%. The exact percentage of yield losses due to insects varies a lot depending on
                    several factors, such as the time of attack and potential crop protection measures.
                    In some cases, insects can harm the crop production completely and cause significant losses for farmers.
                    Furthermore, the economic impact of insects on crop production is not only measured by the cost of the
                    damage on crops, but also by the resources spent on crop insect protection.<br><br>
                    In an attempt to protect their crops from insects, farmers practice various crop protection measures.
                    These include:<br><br>
                    <b>Preventive measures:</b><br>
                    • Planting resistant varieties<br>
                    • Adaptation of planting and harvesting time<br>
                    • Crop rotation<br>
                    • Various hygiene measures (healthy and quality planting material, infestation of equipment)<br><br>

                    <b>Defense measures:</b><br>
                    • Biological; various beneficial viruses, fungi, bacteria, and insects as predators (ladybug)<br>
                    • Cultural; tracking of weather, monitoring of fields and crops<br>
                    • Physical; collecting insects and their destruction, disinfection of the soil, seed, and seedlings<br>
                    • Chemical, use of insecticides<br><br>

                    The final measure of a farmer’s crop protection practice depends on the type of crop production.
                    Conventional farmers use various pesticides as a most common protection measure.

                  <img src="assets\images\insectPest3.jpg" class="center" alt="Dealing with insect pests" width="35%"
                    height="50%">
                  <p>Integrated farmers combine very restricted use of pesticides with the use of various biological,
                    cultural,
                    and physical measures.<br><br>
                    On the other hand, organic farmers rely on completely natural crop protection practices based on
                    preventative, biological, cultural, and physical measures.<br><br>
                    Regardless, every farmer is responsible for his own crop insect protection. So, the final question is: How
                    to deal with insect pests? Unfortunately, there is no one answer. However, by practicing good farm
                    management practices such as those aforementioned preventative measures, a farmer can significantly reduce
                    potential risk. Most importantly, track your crops and fields, because nothing compares to on-time
                    reaction.

                  <h1>Setting up fish ponds</h1>
                  <h2>Site selection:</h2>
                  <p>The success of a fish business depends on the selection of the right place. The site chosen must have a
                    good water supply all year round and the soil must have a good water retention capacity. Site selection
                    factors can be divided into 3 categories as:<br>
                    • Biological<br>
                    • Ecological<br>
                    • Social</p>
                  <img src="assets\images\fishFarming2.jpg" class="center" alt="Fish Farming" width="35%" height="50%">
                  <p>1.Biological Factors<br><br>
                    Biological factors are concerned with fish species chosen for culture purposes. Seed source, variety,
                    culture type, species, etc. must be considered at the time of establishing a fish farm.<br><br>
                    2.Ecological Factors<br><br>
                    Climate, soil, water and topography are the primary factors that must be considered when constructing fish
                    farming ponds. These can be enumerated as below:<br>
                    • Primarily the soil must be able to hold water in a pond. That is it must have good water retention
                    capacity.<br>
                    • Take a handful of soil in wet hand and squeeze it. If the soil retains the shape after opening the
                    palms,
                    the soil is suitable for establishing a pond.<br>
                    • Rocky, limestone, sandy soil must be avoided since they cannot retain water.<br>
                    • Loamy soil, clayey soil, silt etc. are best suited for pond construction.<br>
                    • Gravel if present must not be more than 10%.<br>
                    • Water must have a neutral pH. In case of acidic or alkaline water suitable corrections must be done.<br>
                    • The pond must be constructed near natural water bodies like ponds or rivers. However, it should be away
                    from flooding area.<br>
                    • Water salinity is another factor that must be considered as not all fish can tolerate saline water.<br>
                    • Land topography is essential for engineering the pond construction. Areas like industrial zone, flood
                    prone areas, areas with poor rainfall, electricity poles and densely rooted vegetation must be
                    avoided.<br>
                    3.Social Factors<br><br>
                    Considering social factors while starting a fish business may sound paradoxical. This is however important
                    since the tradition and culture of the place must be taken into account. This would ensure acceptance of
                    the
                    farm by the locales and no legal issues. Other factors include market aspects, transportation,
                    accessibility, infrastructural facilities, etc.

                  <h2>What is Irrigation?</h2>
                  <p>Irrigation is the process of applying water to the crops artificially to fulfil their water requirements.
                    Nutrients may also be applied to the crops through irrigation. The various sources of water for irrigation
                    are wells, ponds, lakes, canals, tube-wells, and even dams. Irrigation offers moisture required for growth
                    and development, germination, and other related functions.<br>
                    Water moistens the soil and thus helps in penetration of roots even into the dry field. The frequency,
                    rate,
                    amount and time of irrigation are different for different crops and also vary according to the types of
                    soils and seasons. For example, summer crops require a higher rate of water as compared to winter
                    crops.<br>
                    Let us have a look at different types of irrigation and the methods used for irrigation.

                  <h2>Types of Irrigation</h2>
                  <p>There are different types of irrigation practised for improving crop yield. These types of irrigation
                    systems are practised based on the different types of soils, climates, crops and resources. The main types
                    of irrigation followed by farmers include:<br>
                    Surface Irrigation:
                    In this system, no irrigation pump is involved. Here, water is distributed across the land by gravity.<br>
                    Localized Irrigation:
                    In this system, water is applied to each plant through a network of pipes under low pressure.<br>
                    Sprinkler Irrigation:
                    Water is distributed from a central location by overhead high-pressure sprinklers or from sprinklers from
                    the moving platform.<br>
                    Drip Irrigation:
                    In this type, drops of water are delivered near the roots of the plants. This type of irrigation is rarely
                    used as it requires more maintenance <br>
                    Centre Pivot Irrigation:
                    In this, the water is distributed by a sprinkler system moving in a circular pattern.<br>
                    Sub Irrigation:
                    Water is distributed through a system of pumping stations gates, ditches and canals by raising the water
                    table.<br>
                    Manual Irrigation:
                    This a labour intensive and time-consuming system of irrigation. Here, the water is distributed through
                    watering cans by manual labour.<br>
                  </p>
                  <h2>Methods of Irrigation</h2>
                  <p>Irrigation can be carried out by two different methods:<br>
                    • Traditional Methods<br>
                    • Modern Methods<br><br>
                    Traditional Methods of Irrigation:<br>
                    In this method, irrigation is done manually. Here, a farmer pulls out water from wells or canals by
                    himself
                    or using cattle and carries to farming fields. This method can vary in different regions.
                    The main advantage of this method is that it is cheap. But its efficiency is poor because of the uneven
                    distribution of water. Also, the chances of water loss are very high.
                    Some examples of traditional system are pulley system, lever system, chain pump and dhekli. Among these,
                    the
                    pump system is the most common and used widely.<br><br>
                    Modern Methods of Irrigation:<br>
                    The modern method compensates the disadvantages of traditional methods and thus helps in the proper way of
                    water usage.<br>
                    The modern method involves two systems:<br>
                    • Sprinkler system
                    • Drip system
                  </p>
                  <h1>Sprinkler System</h1>
                  <img src="assets\images\irrigation3.jpg" class="center" alt="Irrigation Systems" width="35%" height="50%">
                  <p>A sprinkler system, as its name suggests, sprinkles water over the crop and helps in an even distribution
                    of water. This method is much advisable in areas facing water scarcity.
                    Here a pump is connected to pipes which generate pressure and water is sprinkled through nozzles of pipes.
                  </p><br>

                  <p>In Drip system, water supply is done drop by drop exactly at roots using a hose or pipe. This method can
                    also be used in regions where water availability is less.</p>

                  <p>Organic fertilizers comprise a variety of plant-derived materials that range from fresh or dried plant
                    material to animal manures and litters to agricultural by-products. The nutrient content of organic
                    fertilizers varies greatly among source materials, and readily biodegradable materials make better
                    nutrient
                    sources. Nitrogen and phosphorus content is lower, often substantially lower, in organic fertilizers
                    compared the chemical fertilizers. Moisture content is another factor that reduces or dilutes the nitrogen
                    and phosphorus concentrations of organic fertilizers. Thus, it can be cost ineffective to transport
                    high-moisture organic fertilizer long distances. However, use of locally available sources is perfectly
                    reasonable if its use is consistent with the production strategy. Nutrient value of animal manures is more
                    variable than that of agricultural by-products. The animal's diet, the use and type of bedding material,
                    manure age, and how it was stored are factors that affect manure nutrient value; these factors can vary
                    seasonally on and among farms, and regionally or on a larger geographic scale. In contrast, nutrient
                    content
                    of agricultural by-products is less variable but can be affected by the industrial process used to produce
                    the by-product. However, it always is advisable to analytically determine the nutrient content of the
                    organic fertilizer.</p>

                  <h2>Some organic fertilizers:</h2>
                  <p>Manure for the garden comes from cow, sheep, poultry and horses. Pretty self-explanatory. Manure is known
                    as a “complete” fertilizer; it has a lot of organic matter, but is low in nutrients. Manures are most
                    valuable as organic soil amendments and mulches. Note: Beware of using fresh manure as a fertilizer
                    because
                    it can burn plants.<br><br>
                    Blood meal is dried, powdered blood collected from cattle slaughterhouses. It’s such a rich source of
                    nitrogen that gardeners have to be careful not to over-apply and burn the roots of their plants. Apply
                    bone
                    meal just before planting to stimulate green leafy growth.<br><br>
                    Bone meal is finely ground bone. A by-product from animal slaughterhouses, it is a great source of calcium
                    and contains up to 15% phosphate. Bone meal promotes strong root systems and flowering. It is often used
                    when growing flowers, bulbs and fruit trees.<br><br>
                    Bat guano is protected by caves from leaching, so nutrients are conserved. It is rich in soluble nitrogen,
                    phosphorous and trace elements. Usually powdery, bat guano may be used any time of year as a top dressing
                    or
                    diluted in a tea and used as a foliar spray.<br><br>
                    South American seabird guano is among the world’s best. It is gathered off the rocks of arid sea islands,
                    where rainfall and decomposition is minimal. As a result, seabird guano is very high in nitrogen,
                    phosphorous and other nutrients. At Planet Natural, we offer all kinds of garden supplies, including
                    guanos,
                    which provide plant nutrients in a natural form.<br><br>
                    Shellfish fertilizer or shell meal is made from crushed bones or shells from crab or other shellfish. It
                    is
                    a great source of calcium in addition to phosphorus and many trace minerals. One benefit of shellfish
                    fertilizer: it contains chitin which encourages the growth of organisms that inhibit harmful pest
                    nematodes.<br><br>

                    Rock phosphate is a calcium or lime-based phosphate rock that is usually ground to the consistency of
                    small
                    crumbs. This rock powder contains over 30% phosphate and a large number of trace elements. Rock phosphate
                    does not leach out of the soil, remaining unchanged until taken up by the roots.<br><br>

                    Greensand is an iron potassium silicate that gives the minerals in which it occurs a green tint. Mined
                    from
                    an ancient New Jersey sea bed deposit of shells, Greensand is rich in iron, potassium and numerous
                    micronutrients.<br><br>

                    Fish emulsion is a partially decomposed blend of finely pulverized fish. It can smell, although some
                    deodorized versions have been developed. Like blood meal, it should be used sparingly in order not to burn
                    plant roots.<br><br>
